# Memory Game: Project 2 by Udacity's Front-End Web Development Nanodegree
## Student: Emily Orosco Nu√±ez



## Project Description 

Use HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## Game Instructions

To play, load the index.html file via Chrome and when you are ready to begin click the deck of cards. Your game will have initiated when the first click is documented. 

To win, you must successfully match all cards. Once you finish playing, you can choose to play again.  

### Known Bugs

This game does have a significant bug, which is that if the user clicks on more cards too quickly after already having clicked two, the game will take the last two cards cards or the card that was already flipped and the last card to be clicked and compare them instead. This causes a code-error which prevents the user from having an inaccurate tracking of moves. 

Currently trying to solve this issue.
