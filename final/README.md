# Neighborhood App: Project 7 by Udacity's Front-End Web Development Nanodegree
## Student: Emily Orosco Nu√±ez



## Project Description

You will develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Application Instructions
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
